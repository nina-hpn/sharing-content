# First word

So recently, I have learned that you should not be afraid to share things you believe in. And that will be what I targeted when I created this folder.

These sharings would start with planning different contents and then linking slides, blogs, or adds in images to that.

## First lesson (Update 2022-09-22)
The first section should be about what you should know when entering the workplace. I will set a prerequisite that you guys will work in tech since all of my experience comes from going to companies working with technology.
Go see the [first-brainstorm.md](general-knowledge/what-to-know-fresher-version/planning/first-brainstorm.md) file for more details.

This is targeted for people who are freshers or juniors. I will try to cover the following topics:

- Workflow
- Agile and Scrum/Kanban
- Communication between the team

## Second lesson (Update 2022-09-22)
The second section is about what you should prepare for job application and my experience during job interview. 
I will try to cover the following topics:

- Guidelines to choose your first job
- Roadmap
- Create your CV and promote yourself
