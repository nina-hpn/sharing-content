# What should you know when entering the workplace?

*Note: this is a draft version of my plan and includes my thoughts on different problems you might face.*

Before going in-depth into what is needed in a workplace, I would say that things vary from place to place. That said, I want to share my experience with all the juniors who can take less time to figure it out and get a better flow when they enter the workplace.

I will set a prerequisite that you guys will work in tech since all of my experience comes from going to companies working with technology.

These are the thing I would like to cover:
- [Workflow](./scrum/workflow.md)
- [CV preparing](./enter-workplace/CV-preparing.md)
- [Working together techinique](./work-sharing/planning.md)
